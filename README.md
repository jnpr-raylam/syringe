# Syringe

Syringe is a sister project to [Antidote](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote), which provides an in-browser infrastructure automation learning platform. Syringe's role is to provide all of the back-end orchestration to make this possible. It provides a layer of middleware between the `antidote-web` front-end, and the Kubernetes cluster where all of Antidote's lesson entities are running.

The [Syringe documentation](https://syringeproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is your one-stop shop for more details, so go check it out!
